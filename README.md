This repo is for the personal homepage of **Oliver Baptiste**,
a web designer & developer based in New York City.

## Site under construction

### Blog

I would like to start blogging on this site, discussing topics like:

- electronics
  - mechanical keyboards
  - retrocomputing
- interactive media design
  - CSS
  - HTML
  - JavaScript & TypeScript
  - UI design & human–computer interaction
- music & audio production

I want to author my posts in Markdown and generate a static site with something like [Astro](https://astro.build).

### Portfolio

I would like to create an interactive web app for this site that showcases my design & development work.

I would like to use this as an opportunity to explore a UI framework/library like [Vue](https://vuejs.org).
