# Experimenting with Sonic Pi

I was playing with Sonic Pi
for macOS tonight, trying to
play softsynths in Ableton
Live 11. I got IAC working in
**Audio MIDI Setup** and was
able to transit notes from
Sonic Pi to a MIDI channel in
Live.

An interesting thing about the
code editor is that it does
not use native macOS shortcuts
for text manipulation. Its
shortcut set uses 
<kbd>Control</kbd>,
and <kbd>Meta</kbd> (Command).
This causes conflicts with
defaults like:

- Screenshots
- Mission Control

It is more like Emacs, which
is not fun on a laptoo with
only one, small,
awkwardly-located left-hand
key. Performance TKL?
